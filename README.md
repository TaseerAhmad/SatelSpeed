# SatelSpeed

Android GPS Speedometer using FusedLocationProvider API.

Basic functions like current speed, distance travelled, GPS strength / loss warning work. The code I wrote was experimental and I am not satisfied with it's quality.

Created this app to learn how to:
- Calculate Speed using GPS
- Try to cover extreme / error cases gracefully
- Work with maps
